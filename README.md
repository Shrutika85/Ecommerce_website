"The wise words of philosopher Heraclitus remind us that change is the only constant in life. To contribute to the digital transformation of India, we must embrace new technologies. Currently, online shopping is gaining popularity worldwide due to its time and effort-saving benefits. However, when it comes to products that require precise measurements, like clothes, customers often face challenges. Selecting the wrong clothing size is a common issue for many online shoppers, leading to an increase in returns and customer dissatisfaction.

In response to this problem, our capstone project, CLOTHIIFY – “The look you need, the convenience you crave”, aims to develop an innovative e-commerce website. We propose to create a strong AI-powered backend using Python that can estimate body measurements from real-time pictures. By accurately calculating the customer's body size, the platform will recommend the best-fitting clothes tailored to their specific measurements. CLOTHIIFY will cater to users of all ages, genders, and groups, showcasing trending clothing options.

To avail of this service, users will simply sync a front-angled picture, and the platform will provide them with a filtered view of clothing options in their size. They can then conveniently add products to their Wishlist/Cart and place orders with confidence, knowing they have found their perfect fit."![Uploading c2.png…]()
